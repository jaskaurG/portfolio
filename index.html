      <hr />
      <p>Over the last six years, I’ve honed my QA automation skills across a variety of environments—from capital markets and financial services to fast-paced e-commerce platforms. I’ve built and maintained test automation frameworks to keep software dependable and up to spec, while also collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to move projects forward. Open communication and shared objectives have consistently led to smoother workflows, and I love seeing deliverables improve as everyone gets on the same page.</p><br>
      <p>Along the way, I’ve become proficient with tools like Selenium, Java, and CI/CD pipelines, and I make it a point to identify defects early so development remains agile and ready to adapt. Beyond the technical side, I’m equally passionate about growth and mentorship—there’s nothing more rewarding than guiding junior teammates, helping them expand their skills, and watching them make meaningful contributions.</p><br>
      <p>At the end of the day, I’m driven by a desire to exceed expectations. Whether I’m tackling complex trading workflows or ensuring seamless customer journeys in an e-commerce setting, my focus is on leaving a lasting impact and continually raising the bar for software quality assurance.</p><br>
